# ❤️ Heart Rhythm Classification from Raw ECG Signals

This project involves classifying heart rhythms based on raw ECG signals. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between different rhythm classes using time-series ECG data.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following files:

- **train.csv**: Labeled ECG signals for training.
- **test.csv**: Unlabeled ECG signals for testing.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A template for submission format.

Each row represents an ECG signal with up to **17,807** data points (sampled at **300 Hz**). Due to varying signal lengths, some values are padded with `NaN`, which can be safely ignored.

## 🫀 ECG Signal Structure

The ECG (electrocardiogram) signal records the electrical activity of the heart and includes several characteristic waveforms:

- **P wave**: Atrial depolarization
- **QRS complex**: Ventricular depolarization
- **T wave**: Ventricular repolarization

These features help in identifying different heart conditions when extracted and analyzed properly.

## 🔍 Feature Extraction

Each ECG signal is segmented into individual **heartbeat templates**, typically using peak detection and signal processing libraries.

We use the **`biosppy`** library to extract meaningful features from each signal, such as:

- Peak intervals (RR intervals)
- Amplitude of QRS complex
- Signal shape and slopes
- Time-domain and frequency-domain features

## 🧠 Model Overview

We train a classifier that predicts one of **four classes** based on the extracted features:

- **Class 0** – Normal
- **Class 1** – Rhythm Type A
- **Class 2** – Rhythm Type B
- **Class 3** – Noisy or unclear signal

### Example Data and Classification Output:

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

The primary evaluation metric is the **F1 Score (micro-averaged)**, which balances **precision** and **recall**:

**Formula**:

F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
